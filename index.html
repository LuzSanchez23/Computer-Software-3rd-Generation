            <h2>1965-1971</h2>
            <P>The computers of third generation used Integrated Circuits (ICs) in place of transistors. The IC was
                invented by Jack Kilby. The third generation was brought about by advances in the manufacture of
                transistors; scientists and engineers that where able to this development made computers smaller in size,
                reliable, and efficient. In this generation remote processing, time-sharing, multiprogramming operating
                system were used. The main features of the third-generation computers were that they; used Integrated
                Circuits, reliable in comparison to previous two generations, smaller in size, generated less heat,
                faster in terms of speed, lesser maintenance, still costly, A.C needed, and consumed lesser electricity.
                computers were cheaper in price, smaller in size, less heavy in weight, faster in speed and more
                efficient. It was during this time that many high-level programming languages were gaining widespread
                use, programming languages such as C, Pascal, COBOL and FORTRAN. Magnetic storage also became more
                popular in this era</P>
